After looking at the solutions to week 7 and comparing them to my answers I feel like they are exactly the same. I think I got down the process of making super classes 
and understand better how the concept works. I think that object oriented programming is amazing and makes programming way more connected and structured rather than having 
a mess of one file. I think that these past few weeks have taught me the most about how code should be structured and what type of data storage and data manipulation can be 
used and the syntax of them. I think that I nailed week 7 homework as it is exactly the same as the solutions and I really understood the process that was given to me to learn.
